        <h1>5 Things to Consider When Picking a Destination</h1>
        <p>When evaluating a place to live and work from, there are numerous factors that determine if it is right <br> for you. After over 14 years of <strong style="padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 20px; border: 4px solid rgb(4, 38, 228); color: rgb(230, 74, 27);">being a digital nomad</a></strong>, I know what matters — and what doesn’t. <br>Here are the five most important things you’ll want to consider:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slow">
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Wi-Fi connectivity</h3>
            </li>
            <p id="better">If you’re working online, reliable Wi-Fi is vital. You don’t want to be wasting your day trying to <br> find Wi-Fi. I always check the reviews of the places I stay for comments specifically about the <br>Wi-Fi. When in doubt, email the Airbnb host/hostel/hotel directly and ask them about their internet speeds —<br> because nothing is more frustrating than slow Wi-Fi — no Wi-Fi is better than slow Wi-Fi if you ask me! <br> Moreover, Google the destinations you are thinking about —if they have a lot of coworking spaces, they <br> usually also have reliable Wi-Fi.</p>
